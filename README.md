**Frequency Analyzer with Kalman Filter**
This project implements a frequency analyzer for audio signals with noise reduction using the Kalman filter. The analyzer works in both time and frequency domains, providing a clear comparison between raw and filtered audio signals. The Kalman filter helps in reducing high-frequency noise present in the raw audio signal.

Features
Kalman Filter: Reduces noise in audio signals by applying a Kalman filter.
Time-Domain Analysis: Visualizes both raw and filtered audio signals in the time domain.
Frequency Domain Analysis: Analyzes and plots the frequency spectrum of raw and filtered audio signals using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
Audio File Support: Reads and processes audio files in .wav format.
